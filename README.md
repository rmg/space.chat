Space.Chat
==========

Browser based chat using socket.io and Express on Node.

Ideas
-----

So far this is just the skeleton of a websockets based chat server.

The next step is to find a nice HTML5 asteroids clone to use as a starting point for an avatar based
chat that uses little ships floating around space.

 * animated shields for away status
 * ship staying still (minor float movement) to indicate idle
 * ship increases in speed as user types, indicating activity to others
 * weapon firing to indicate direct messaging
 * explosion on exit
 * ???

Demo
----

I was surprised at how easy it is to deploy to Heroku. Those guys really know what they're doing!
